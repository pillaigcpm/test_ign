Another way to deepen your understanding is by looking to the experts in
your field. Find the experts and recreate their results, not by trying to dis-
prove them or simply following them, but through exploring their process
and trying to figure it out yourself. This may take several attempts but will
lead to you overcoming obstacles and learning how to struggle.
