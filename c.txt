When learning gets difficult, it’s important to not give up. In fact, when
faced with a difficult problem, that is when the most learning occurs. Addi-
tionally, if you come across two ways to solve a problem, avoid taking the
shorter avenue. It is important to struggle and take a long avenue to solve
the problem since it will lead to better learning and understanding. If you
find that a problem is too difficult, set a timer. Force yourself to struggle for
ten minutes, and if you don’t solve the problem during that time, you’ll be
more likely to remember the answer when you do find it.
